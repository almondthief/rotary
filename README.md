# Rotary Inverted Pendulum
Honours Thesis Python Code. Simulation and control of a Rotary Inverted Pendulum system (RIP) using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with Iterative Dynamic Programming (IDP) as the optimisation algorithm adapted and used. 

List of jupyter notebooks provided:

File Name  | Function
------------- | -------------
Rotary Inverted Pendulum NMPC Scheme  | Contains all system dynamics, control algorithm and simulation scripts
Plots | Produces useful graphs for cost function analysis and simulation result data
IDP Parameter Testing | Scripts used for testing IDP parameters

Some .csv files from test simulations and graphs of the results added as well.
