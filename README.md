# Rotary Inverted Pendulum
Honours Thesis Python Code

Simulation and control of a rotary inverted pendulum system using NMPC with IDP as the optimisation algorithm adapted and used. Two jupyter notebooks, one having all system dynamics and control simulation scripts, the second being set to produce useful graphs to analyse the results. 

Some csv files from test simulations and graphs of the results added.
